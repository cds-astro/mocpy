What is a MOC ?
---------------

MOC is an `IVOA standard <http://ivoa.net/documents/MOC/>`__ enabling description
of arbitrary sky regions. Based on the HEALPix sky tessellation, it maps
regions on the sky into hierarchically grouped predefined cells.

MOCPy provides the :py:class:`~mocpy.MOC` and :py:class:`~mocpy.TimeMOC` classes handling
respectively the manipulation of spatial and temporal MOCs.

As an example, here is the sky coverage of the SDSS sky survey:

.. plot:: examples/plot_SDSS_r.py

As well as its time coverage:

.. plot:: examples/plot_TMOC_SDSS_r.py
